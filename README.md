# 🎮 Hybrid MERN + Gaming + LeetCode Roadmap

This repository tracks my **6-month plan** to become job-ready in **MERN stack, game development, and DSA**, with daily GitHub contributions.

**Legend:**  
- 🟦 MERN (Node, Express, MongoDB, React, Auth)  
- 🟩 Gaming (Unity / Godot / Phaser / JS games)  
- 🟪 LeetCode / Algorithms  
- 🟨 Daily GitHub commits  

## Structure
- `/Monthly` → Daily task templates for each month
- `/MERN` → MERN projects
- `/Gaming` → Mini-games and larger projects
- `/LeetCode` → Solutions & practice problems
- `/assets` → Screenshots, gameplay videos

## Goals
1. Daily commits for consistency  
2. Complete 1–2 MERN mini-projects per month  
3. Build 1–2 game projects per month  
4. Solve medium/hard DSA problems consistently  
5. Prepare portfolio and demo games by April 2026
